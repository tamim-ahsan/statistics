**Purpose**

Within this document, I try to summarize my understandings of key statistical concepts in a few sentences.

# Hypothesis Testing

- The goal is to find if a _value of interest_  emerges out of _pattern_ or _randomness_ 

- In other words, the goal is to find whether the changes in the _response variable_ depend on the changes in an _explanatory variable_ or the changes are _random_ and _independent_

- If 

- - a distribution is created with _random_ numbers
  
  - and the _value of interest_ turns out to be an extreme value within that distribution,
  
  then there is a _pattern_ that could be of interest.
