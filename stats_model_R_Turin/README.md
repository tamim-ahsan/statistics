Within this directory, I store the scripts as I go through the codes and exercises for statistical modeling in R from the Polytechnic University of Turin. The contents can be accessed [here](https://toyo97.github.io/statistical-models-r/)

By exploring the chapters of this practical course, I learned
1. Sampling from various distributions
2. Fitting linear models
3. Fitting and assessing generalized linear models (binomial, poisson, negative binomial)
4. Dealing with zero inflation (zero-inflated and hurdle models)
5. Dealing with interactions
