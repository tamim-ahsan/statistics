Within this directory, I store the codes for fitting linear models, mainly in R.\
So far, there are scripts for fitting -
1. a simple linear regression manually using basic matrix algebra operations and comparing the results to linear regression fitted with the lm() function in R,
2. multiple linear regression and dealing with interactions between explanatory variables,
3. linear mixed effect model,
4. principal components regression for handling multicollinearlity
5. partial least squares regression for handling multicollinearity
