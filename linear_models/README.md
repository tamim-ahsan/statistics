Within this directory, I store the codes for fitting linear models, mainly in R.\
So far, there are scripts for -\
1. fitting a simple linear regression manually using basic matrix algebra operations and comparing the results to linear regression fitted with the lm() function in R,
2. fitting multiple linear regression and dealing with interactions between explanatory variables,\
3. fitting linear mixed effect model
