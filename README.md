# Statistics

**Purpose**

- This repository contains the codes that I wrote as I followed along various workshops and tutorials on statistical anlayses

- The contents of each directory include the codes from individual workshop/tutorial series organized in multiple sudirectories, each of which contains scripts, datasets and notes summarizing the keypoints (based on my understanding) 

- Wherever applicable, I provided links to the resouces I used
